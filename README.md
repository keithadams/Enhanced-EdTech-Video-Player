# Enhanced EdTech Video Player

## Code Viewing Purposes Only

Non-operational. This codebase is missing assets from a paid webpage template that I'm not licensed to share publicly. This repository is published for sharing code samples only.


## Description

This video player prototype enables the user to sort video comments the following way:

- Sort by Rectangular Selection
  - The user can drag and highlight a portion of the video and comments will sort based on the rectangular selection
- Sort by text similarity to current subtitles
- Sort by timestamp
- Sort by user keyword search
- Sort by combination of all the above

The intent of the enhanced comment sorting is to empower students to discover highly relevant comments at the section of the video they're currently viewing. This takes advantage of context as well as the historical value of previous students engaging with course instructors in Q&A.
