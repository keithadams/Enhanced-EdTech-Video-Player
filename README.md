## Description

This demos a video player prototype that enables the user to sort video comments the following way:

- Sort by Rectangular Selection
  - User can drag and highlight a portion of the video and comments will sort based on timestamp and rectangular selection
- Sort by text similarity to current subtitles
- Sort by timestamp
- Sort by user keyword search
- Sort by combination of all the above

The intent of the enhanced comment sorting is to empower students to discover highly relevant comments at the current section of the video. This takes advantage of current context as well as the historical value of previous students engaging in the course.
