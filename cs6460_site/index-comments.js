        "replies" : ["This might be a useful memory trick, but it could also be confusing. The Latin root 'deca' or sometimes just 'dec' actually means 10 (ten), not 12 (twelve). This is apparent in words such as 'decade' which is 10 (ten) years, or 'decimal' (the first position beyond a decimal point is the 'tenths' position). So, for instance, a 'decagon' would be a 10 (ten) sided object or a '10-gon.' You wouldn't want to accidentally confuse a 'decagon' which is 10 (ten) sided with a 'dodecagon' which is 12 (twelve) sided because of a misapplication of this trick. The actual meaning of the word 'dodecagon' can be seen from breaking it up into its parts like like this: 'do' + 'deca' + 'gon.' 'Do' means 2 (two) like 'dos' in Spanish or like 'do' in the word 'double' which means to multiply by 2 (two). 'Deca' (like we've already discussed) means 10 (ten). 'Gon' is Greek for 'corner, bend, or angle.' Two dimensional polygons always have the same number 'bends' or 'corners' as they have sides. So a 'do-deca-gon' means a 'two-plus-ten-cornered-object' which is what a 12-gon actually is. The false connection between 'Deca' which means 10 (ten) and December arises because of a strange historical anomaly, which is that December USED TO BE the tenth month. Yes, I'm serious: at one time the Romans used a 10 (ten) month calendar. This is still apparent in several month names: September, October, November, and December. 'Sept' in September means 7 (seven), but now it is the ninth month, 'Oct' in October means 8 (eight), but now it is the tenth month, 'Nov' in November means 9 (nine), but now it is the eleventh month. When the Romans added two more months, they didn't change the names of the months that had numbers built into their names. Now we represent each of those months by a number that is worth two more than its name would imply. Hence December, which means 'tenth month' is the twelfth month of the year and we write December 1, 2017 as 12/1/2017 (in the United States) or as 1/12/2017 (everywhere else in the world)."]
